# Lifebox
A simple experiment with automata, canvas rendering and multithreaded javascript.

## To run
Open the repo in a terminal, then run
```
./serve.sh
```
or
```
python -m http.server 8000
```
directly.

Then, go to http://0.0.0.0:8000

## Notes
- ensure the sim is closed when you're done
- tweak the sim by adjusting CONFIG in main.js, eg. **fullGridSize** sets the sim scale
